My plan is to make my own Machine Learning Library

Future Plans:
* Adding different layer types (Ie Recurrent, LSTM, Bayesian, Convolutional, etc)
* Adding more Activation Functions
* Adding Optimizers
* Adding ability to handle different input dimensions
* Adding other machine learning models
* Speeding training up by leveraging Parrallel programming
* List not exhaustive
